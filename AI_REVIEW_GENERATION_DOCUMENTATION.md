## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No reviews generated**
- Check user availability (need users without existing reviews)
- Verify product exists and has valid data
- Check database constraints

**Word count validation fails**
- Templates automatically adjust content
- Manual adjustment algorithms ensure compliance
- All generated reviews meet 30-70 word requirement

**Performance issues**
- Reduce batch size: `--batch-size=50`
- Add delays between batches
- Monitor memory usage during generation

**Database constraints**
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate user-product reviews
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- Automatic rollback on constraint violations

## Best Practices

### Production Deployment
1. **Test First**: Always run with `--dry-run` and small `--limit`
2. **Off-Peak Hours**: Run during low-traffic periods
3. **Monitor Resources**: Watch database and memory usage
4. **Backup First**: Backup database before large generations
5. **Gradual Rollout**: Process in smaller batches initially

### Quality Control
1. **Review Samples**: Check generated content quality
2. **Monitor Statistics**: Verify rating distributions
3. **User Feedback**: Monitor for any quality issues
4. **Adjust Templates**: Customize for your market if needed

## Support

For issues or customizations:
1. Check log files for detailed error information
2. Use `--dry-run` to test configuration
3. Start with small batches for troubleshooting
4. Monitor system resources during generation

The AI Review Generation System provides a powerful, scalable solution for creating authentic product reviews that enhance customer trust and provide valuable social proof for your e-commerce platform.
